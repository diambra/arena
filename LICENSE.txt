  THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY

HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM "AS IS" WITHOUT WARRANTY
OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,

  IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS

This program is a mere software interface to existing video games, and cannot 
work as a standalone application. As such, it requires the User to own software
elements protected by copyright, and to interface them with it. 
It is the case, for example, of Game ROMS required to execute the corresponding 
Game-related Environment. In such cases, it is sole and only responsibility of 
the User to comply with all the laws and regulations, and to make sure he has the 
right to use such copyright-protected material. DIAMBRA members do not support 
in any way piracy, and illegal distribution of copyright-protected material, 
thus they will spend their maximum effort in avoiding illegal distribution of 
such material, and are by no means responsible for copyright infringement.
